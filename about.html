<p>Hi, I'm Meindra and this is my personal website.</p>
<p>I'm a front-end developer currently living in Tulungagung, Indonesia.</p>
<img src="/images/about.jpg" alt="">
<p>I started coding since 2013 (though I already messing around with html and css since 2008). I used to code using PHP, but right now I'm using JavaScript as my primary programming language.</p>
<p>After completing my degree in Informatics Engineering in 2015, I spent two and a half years freelancing as a web developer and graphic designer. I also did some front-end projects to improve my front-end skills.</p>
