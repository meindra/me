<p>Hi, I'm Meindra and this is my personal website.</p>
<p>I'm a web developer (mostly front-end stuff) based in Tulungagung, Indonesia.</p>

<p>After finishing my degree in Informatics Engineering at the end of 2015, I spent a couple years doing freelance work as a web developer and graphic designer. I also did some digital art editing work for an artist.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working as a designer and developer in a local design agency.</p>
